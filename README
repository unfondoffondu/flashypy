AAA Anonymous Aardvark Association
BBBB Better Buckets By Brandy

The answers need to be lower case and I did my best to sanitize the input from the file, but sometimes it 
gets funky and you may have to change the file where it is messed up.  It is very picky in regards to grammar
and plurality, so be careful!
